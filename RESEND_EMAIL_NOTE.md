# Resend Email Configuration - Important Note

## Current Setup

**Emails are being sent to**: anufypanda@gmail.com

### Why?

Resend's free tier has a restriction:
- You can **only send to the email address you signed up with**
- In your case, that's: **anufypanda@gmail.com**
- To send to other emails (like hs8339952@gmail.com), you need to verify a domain

## Solutions

### Option 1: Forward Emails (Quick & Easy)

Set up email forwarding in Gmail:

1. Log into **anufypanda@gmail.com**
2. Go to Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP
3. Add forwarding address: **hs8339952@gmail.com**
4. Confirm the forwarding
5. All contact form emails will auto-forward!

### Option 2: Verify a Domain (Professional)

If you have a domain (e.g., yourdomain.com):

1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Add your domain and verify DNS records
4. Update `server/index.ts` line 47:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Contact Form <contact@yourdomain.com>',
   to: ['hs8339952@gmail.com'],
   ```

### Option 3: Use Different Email Service

Switch to a service without this restriction:
- **SendGrid** - 100 emails/day free
- **Mailgun** - 5,000 emails/month free (requires credit card)
- **Nodemailer with Gmail** - Free but requires app password

### Option 4: Sign Up with Target Email

Create a new Resend account using **hs8339952@gmail.com**:

1. Sign up at [resend.com/signup](https://resend.com/signup) with hs8339952@gmail.com
2. Get new API key
3. Update `.env` with new key
4. Update `server/index.ts` to send to hs8339952@gmail.com

## Current Workaround

For now, emails go to **anufypanda@gmail.com** with a note to forward to hs8339952@gmail.com.

You can:
- Check anufypanda@gmail.com for submissions
- Set up auto-forwarding (Option 1 above)
- Or switch to Option 4 for direct delivery

## Recommendation

**Best solution**: Set up Gmail forwarding from anufypanda@gmail.com → hs8339952@gmail.com

This way:
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Automatic forwarding
- ✅ Keep using current setup
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes to set up
